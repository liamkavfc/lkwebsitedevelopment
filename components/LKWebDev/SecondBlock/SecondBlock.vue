              Lynn come to me with the simple instructions of "my website needs updating, do what you can". So thats exactly what we did! We updating the colour scheme from dark
              colours to bright happy colours. We have put things that matter onto the homepage and categorised out the other pages from a gallery to price list to make it easy
              for the user to navigate and find what they are looking for.
